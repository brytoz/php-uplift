Classes and Objects:
The User class defines a blueprint for creating user objects.
Objects like $user, $admin, and $moderator are created from these classes.


Encapsulation:
Properties like $name and $email are private, meaning they can only be accessed through methods (getters and setters).


Inheritance:
The Admin and Moderator classes extend the User class, reusing its properties and methods.


Polymorphism:
Both Admin and Moderator classes override the displayInfo method to provide additional information.


Constructors:
The __construct method is used to initialize object properties.
